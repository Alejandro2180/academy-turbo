We will be exploring, testing, real-world applications, security practices, and the role of tokens in decentralised ecosystems. From DeFi to DAO's and everything in between, thanks to its simplicity, but versatility, the ERC-20 is going nowhere. Start with Solidity, or dive directly into token creation â€” empowering you to contribute to blockchain projects."
