## a wee intro here before getting stuck in

i.e web2 - what is it. web3 - what is it. RPCs sub-topic will connect these two dots

## RPCs

**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** could be classified as a type of API
(application programming interface) that allows for developers to run code that
can be executed on servers remotely. In plain English, an RPC call is how a dApp
communicates with the blockchain or accesses other information from remote
servers. In this section, we will concern ourselves with RPC calls to the
blockchain via the Zerion wallet to Ethereum testnets such as Sepolia and an RPC
endpoint provider such as POKT Network.

### Connecting to a Testnet with Zerion

When opening up the Zerion browser extension, we can connect to the various
testnets as seen below by clicking on the extension's icon, the Settings gear ⚙️ wheel,
choosing Networks, and selecting your desired test network:

![Testnets on Zerion](/assets/lessons/connect-with-rpc/test-networks-zerion.png)

If you are trying to view a given network’s RPC connection information, it can be accessed
by clicking on the arrow to the right of the network name. In my case, I am connected to
the Sepolia testnet. You can see its Network Name, RPC URL, Chain ID, Currency Symbol, Decimals and
Block Explorer URL shown below:

### Add a Network

A lot of networks are already pre-loaded in the wallet, otherwise any new network's
details should be given in, e.g. a tutorial that you're working from. A new
network can be added in Zerion by clicking on the **Add Network** button. Then
add the 6 data inputs for your chosen network, similar to the Sepolia example in the
image above.

<br />

An alternative way of adding network choices is through
[the Chainlist website here](https://chainlist.org/). It's quite self-explanatory,
but be sure to check ☑️ the **Include Testnets** option. Chainlist is a rich source
of RPC statistics for EVM's (Ethereum Virtual Machine).

<br />

### Connecting a dApp through an RPC Endpoint Provider

In blockchain development, it is necessary to connect your dApp to the
blockchain to deploy smart contracts and interact with the deployed contract.
This can be done by either running your own blockchain node such as GETH or
accessing the blockchain through an RPC endpoint service. There are many nowadays.
Connecting through a node provider is much easier than running your own node.

<br />
By using a node provider, it is quick and easy, and usually free to open an account that will get you
access to RPC endpoints of many different testnets including Sepolia Ethereum, Polygon Mumbai, Optimistic
Goerli and Scroll Sepolia.
<br />
We're going to look at POKT Network, a decentralized RPC base layer that operates as an ecosystem of
providers, as opposed to a monolithic RPC company. Its network's diverse ecosystem of web3 node operators
ensures uptime, therefore resilience.
<br />
If you're a Developer DAO member, you should be aware of some of the "D_D Perks" for Web3 we have. Let's
take advantage of one of those, and get you hooked up with Grove, one of the _Gateways_ built on top
of POKT Network's RPC baselayer. [Click here for Grove.](https://devdao.to/grove-perk)

<br />
Are you not yet a member of Developer DAO? There is no time like the present. If accessing an RPC Gateway
is a more pressing priority, [choose Nodies, another Gateway from POKT](https://www.nodies.app/) and
set up an account for yourself.

### Important Security Notes

**It is super important to always double-check the website URL you are clicking
on and the pop-up message in Zerion, when connecting your wallet. If you are on
the wrong website and you allow access to your Zerion wallet, you may be allowing
hackers access to it. You don't want that. Always double-check! At Developer DAO
Academy, we strongly advise using a separate browser profile and wallet for
development. Be safe!**

{/\* The websites for the aforementioned RPC endpoint providers can be found
below:

- **Infura**: [**https://infura.io/**](https://infura.io/) Click on the **SIGN
  UP** button.
- **Alchemy**: [**https://www.alchemy.com/**](https://www.alchemy.com/) Click on
  **Login**, then **Signup** under the Login button.
- **Chainstack**: [**https://www.chainstack.com/**](https://www.chainstack.com/)
  Click on the **Start for free** button.
- **Ankr**: [**https://www.ankr.com/**](https://www.ankr.com/) Click on **Get a
  free endpoint**, the **Connect wallet** to connect your Zerion wallet.

**IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS DOUBLE-CHECK THE WEBSITE URL YOU ARE CLICKING
ON AND THE POP-UP MESSAGE IN Zerion WHEN CONNECTING YOUR WALLET. IF YOU ARE ON
THE WRONG WEBSITE AND YOU ALLOW ACCESS TO YOUR Zerion WALLET, YOU MAY BE
ALLOWING HACKERS ACCESS TO YOUR WALLET. BE SAFE!! ALWAYS DOUBLE-CHECK!!** \*/}
