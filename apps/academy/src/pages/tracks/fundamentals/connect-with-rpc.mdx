## a wee intro here before getting stuck in

i.e web2 - what is it. web3 - what is it. RPCs sub-topic will connect these two dots

## RPCs

**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** could be classified as a type of API
(application programming interface) that allows for developers to run code that
can be executed on servers remotely. In plain English, an RPC call is how a dApp
communicates with the blockchain or accesses other information from remote
servers. In this section, we will concern ourselves with RPC calls to the
blockchain via the Zerion wallet to Ethereum testnets such as Sepolia and an RPC
endpoint provider such as POKT Network.

### Connecting to a Testnet with Zerion

When opening up the Zerion browser extension, we can connect to the various
testnets as seen below by clicking on the extension's icon, the Settings gear ⚙️ wheel, choosing Networks, and selecting your desired
test network:

If you are trying to view a given network’s RPC connection information, it can be accessed by clicking on the arrow to the right of the network name. In
my case, I am connected to the Sepolia testnet, so its Network Name, RPC URL, Chain ID,
Currency Symbol, Decimals and Block Explorer URL are shown below:

### Add a Network

A new network can be added in Zerion by clicking on the **Add Network**
button. Then add the 6 data inputs for your chosen network, similar to the Sepolia example in the image above. These should be given in your tutorial, if you're working from one.

An alternative way of adding network choices is through Chainlist. You can find it [here](https://chainlist.org/). It's quite self-explanatory, but be sure to check ☑️ the **Include Testnets** option. Chainlist is a rich source of RPC statistics for EVM's (Ethereum Virtual Machine).

### Connecting a dApp through an RPC Endpoint Provider

In blockchain development, it is necessary to connect your dApp to the
blockchain to deploy smart contracts and interact with the deployed contract.
This can be done by either running your own blockchain node such as GETH or
accessing the blockchain through an RPC endpoint service such as Infura,
Alchemy, Chainstack, Ankr, etc. Connecting through node providers is much easier
than running your own node.

By using a node provider, it is quick, easy and
**FREE** to open an account and get access to RPC endpoints of many different
testnets including Sepolia Ethereum, Polygon Mumbai, Optimism Kovan and Solana
Devnet. The websites for the aforementioned RPC endpoint providers can be found
below:

- **Infura**: [**https://infura.io/**](https://infura.io/) Click on the **SIGN
  UP** button.
- **Alchemy**: [**https://www.alchemy.com/**](https://www.alchemy.com/) Click on
  **Login**, then **Signup** under the Login button.
- **Chainstack**: [**https://www.chainstack.com/**](https://www.chainstack.com/)
  Click on the **Start for free** button.
- **Ankr**: [**https://www.ankr.com/**](https://www.ankr.com/) Click on **Get a
  free endpoint**, the **Connect wallet** to connect your Zerion wallet.

**IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS DOUBLE-CHECK THE WEBSITE URL YOU ARE CLICKING
ON AND THE POP-UP MESSAGE IN Zerion WHEN CONNECTING YOUR WALLET. IF YOU ARE ON
THE WRONG WEBSITE AND YOU ALLOW ACCESS TO YOUR Zerion WALLET, YOU MAY BE
ALLOWING HACKERS ACCESS TO YOUR WALLET. BE SAFE!! ALWAYS DOUBLE-CHECK!!**
